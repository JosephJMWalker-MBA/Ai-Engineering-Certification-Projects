# 04 â€“ Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Working with neural networks for image, audio, and text data.

## Concepts:
- Neural nets, activation functions
- CNNs for image classification
- Keras models & training

## Tools:
- TensorFlow + Keras
- Google Colab

## Applied Use Case:
Prototype visual models for Search & Rescue using thermal imagery or night detection.

## In Progress:
