## üîÅ Cyclical Build Notes

- **Reusability:** Python scripts, visual detection models, and NLP engines will all be re-used across ChristInvestment, Aerial Inspections, and Falah.
- **Portability:** Cloud deployment testing will also double as infrastructure for Haiven's micro-service prototypes.
- **Documentation:** Each major project should be documented as both a deliverable *and* a teachable example (potential course material).
